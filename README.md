# Disease Detection and Prediction System
The Disease Detection and Prediction System is a machine learning-based application developed using Python and Streamlit. This project aims to detect and predict diseases using medical imaging and predictive analytics techniques. It includes the following functionalities:

Breast Cancer Detection: Using ultrasound scans as input, the system performs image classification to identify breast cancer cases.
Brain Tumor Detection: Similarly, the system uses MRI scans to detect brain tumors through image classification.

Features
Breast Cancer Detection: The application utilizes the Inception v3 model for image classification, enabling accurate detection of breast cancer.
Brain Tumor Detection: By employing the Inception v3 model, the system can identify the presence of brain tumors in MRI scans.
Disease Prediction: The system uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression algorithms for disease prediction.
Diabetes Prediction: The application predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on test results like BMI, heart rate, blood pressure, etc.
Heart Disease Prediction: The system predicts the probability of heart disease based on various medical parameters.
